		non-exhaustive
			about: - an actual doctor of actual pure mathematics, with original research
				     in the areas of semigroup theory, lattice path theory and game
				 	 theory (especially symmetric/fair games)
				 - actual duckling (who brought down the aggregate bittorrent site 
				   forum Torrent Playground (TPG) who were helping prevent people from 
				   being able to learn, discuss topics, ask questions, and were tormenting
				   people with specific details about the people they know being sexually 
				   abused, threatened, their loved ones held prisoner and under threats to 
				   not do anything impressive or try to tell anyone about the hostage
				   situation);
				 - have helped identify and fight some of the worst problems on and off
				   the internet, also witnessing some of the worst evidence, helped with 
				   educating the world on things like piracy and ai which both have good 
				   and bad aspects to them, whereas large parts of the world used to just
				   treat both as inherently bad, which contributed to all sorts of 
				   problems throughout society just by itself;
				 - halt3r;
				 - actual antimatroid who finished in the top 1% globally for the 
				   last two Google ai contests, and helped set them up and coded
				   the map generator for both Planet Wars and Ants;
				 - Director and only person involved above/below the contestant level for
				   AI-BOTS PTY. LTD.;
				 - had the original idea, and did all the work including the coding
				   for nifty-site-manager;
				 - actual numbers from Reddit (not including copycats), along with 
				   numerous other alternative identities, including c---8, l-_ol, n-c-h, 
				   nsm, duckling-tm, antimatroid;
				 - tried to get the whole world to get on board with fighting abuse and
				   turning things around for good when I was younger, only for pretty much
				   everyone knowingly joining in with the people who lie, mislead, pressure,
				   rush, threaten, hold people back, steal people's
				   work/identities/achievements/projects/titles/etc., turn victims against 
				   each other, torment, etc. etc.;
				 - had the whole world turn against my actual relationship match and
				   I not wanting to have to be abused by other people and wanting to be 
				   safe when we did everything we could to help other people in the right
				   ways in the community, people have gaslighted the whole world, and made
				   all sorts of people play along for their abusers;
				 - asked the world to go to war with shitcity when I was younger
				   only for the whole world to say they can't bear to witness the
				   problem but don't care Japanese people deserve it apparently, they
				   refused and prevented me from going to war myself, the
				   whole world turned against me (my actual relationship match was lied
				   to and treated horribly when told the truth), of course like many times 
				   prior the world turned around and lie about the whole thing, lying
				   saying I was the one saying we didn't need war and that they were
				   the ones who did, pressuring/forcing my actual relationship match to join
				   in with people gaslighting the world and treating me like a complete
				   joke while holding me back under threats of violence and lying about
				   my actual relationship match wanting to be rescued, even though I had/have
				   done everything I can to help people in need, help the world move forwards
				   from the horrors of the past and have probably managed to solve some of the
				   hardest known unsolved problems with regards to fixing some situations that
				   often screw people over, it seems if you are good at that and can't solve
				   every problem like that you must be the biggest monster on the planet;
				 - have repeatedly had my identities/achievements/results/work/projects
				   stolen by people and used for all sorts of horrible things like ruining
				   people's lives, (sexually) abusing people, causing all sorts of problems
				   to society;
				 - have helped train some of the best athletes, soldiers, academics, extreme
				   sports people etc. all around the world, only for the world to repeatedly
				   throw it in my face by holding me prisoner while people are stuck in
				   abusive situations, not rescuing me from hostage situations, not allowing 
				   me to do things properly, not taking me seriously about what is preventing
				   communities from being safe for the people who are innocent and continue 
				   to hand victims back to their abuser(s);
				 - have offered to help educate and train lots more people if people will
				   commit to not abusing people and help lock up those who don't and/or cause
				   problems, unfortunately the world claims they prefer the victims to have
				   to put up with being sexually abused than to at least learn enough so that
				   the decisions they are making do not just make the victims' situations worse. 
		
			DO NOT publicise WR3CKREATIONAL to people who are not going to be able to 
			understand the implications of all the rules, including 'extrapolating' what
			is and is not acceptable behaviour, which cannot be explained to people
			easily due to people turning around and saying that's what gave them the idea
			to engage in such behaviour in the first place. 
		
			The original intentions for the term WR3CKREATIONAL was a play on words for
			recreational activities that wreck things (it can be a fun exercise to see
			what does and doesn't fall under that category, provided one isn't complicit
			to or guilty of the wrong kinds of abuse as a result of that), with one goal
			being to respect what other things go through for people to train up to fight
			abuse. Unfortunately a lot of people against fighting abuse do everything 
			they can to ruin brand reputation/image and names(s) of people involved with 
			fighting abuse, branding, etc.. Please help identify that kind of behaviour 
			and help rescue the victims from it. The victims need to be safe after being
			rescued too.
		
			WR3CKREATIONAL is for ending the wrong kinds of abuse, anyone who's 
			eligible may consider themselves a member (including brands, companies,
			schools, education boards, tertiary institutions, workplaces, etc.),
			though you will find it is far from safe to reveal your membership,
			especially while the world is run by abusers/rapists and while there are
			hostage situations ongoing globally. Membership is entirely voluntary, 
			though you do need to be eligible.
		
			You are not eligible if you have voluntarily contributed to putting anyone
			in any of the situations that we are trying to put an end to. And should make
			it clear to anyone who knows about WR3CKREATIONAL that we are not interested
			in people making situations like that happen with them claiming they are 
			trying to 'reward people' or some other kind of fucked up excuse to cause
			further harm to the world and everything on it. 
		
			Basic membership requirements are:
				- commited to fighting abuse for life (sometimes fighting abuse involves
				  doing nothing at all);
				- commited to not abusing victims in the wrong ways for life;
				- work hard and when something goes wrong help work out what has happened,
				  help work out who the actual victims/perpetrators are, help rescue the
				  victims, help bring justice for the victims, and help make sure the
				  perpetrators/abusers are kept away from their victims for good.  
		
			The topics to cover in order to be educated on these topics are horrible,
			while it's a terrible idea and impossible to trust people who are even
			educated on these topics, zero trust can be put in to people who are not 
			educated on these topics, whether that's voluntarily, involuntarily and/or 
			because they're incapable of doing so for one or many reasons (eg. unable
			to bear learning enough to have the right opinions, and make the right
			decisions, insufficient ability to reason logically, mathematically, lack of 
			any morals/ethics, inability to be able to genuinely say they're not a rapist
			and would never ever voluntarily be complicit to rape). If people 
			aren't willing to accept that it's a good indication that people either
			are not decent or are under threat, it is important that we as a society
			get to the bottom of these problems and put an end to them for good (or
			figure out how to end things for good). 
		
			Be very weary of people who claim to be decent/non-evil people yet intentionally
			or unintentionally screw over the people they claim to care about while
			helping the people they claim to hate. Though unfortunately while the rapists
			own society (ie. until things are turned around for good or ended for good)
			that is exactly what the victims have to do, and we have very little choice
			but to 'believe' them convincingly because it's better for the victims in the
			meantime. Too many people in society are asleep to that and need to be woken up.
		
			It doesn't matter how old you are, if you aren't helping people have an
			actual choice in life then you are part of the problems of the world, 
			that does not include the people who help set up people having a
			'better/safer life' with the abusers/rapists. Having said that, some choices
			cause too many problems to the community to be allowed, those who voluntarily
			engage in those activities need to be held accountable/responsible for
			their actions.
		
			It is not okay for people to be left prisoner, if people have
			an actual relationship match there are rules about how they are/aren't allowed
			to hold the other person prisoner, especially with regards to just ruining their
			lives behind their back and gaslighting them about wanting to be rescued while
			the whole society/world joins in with it. It is important we separate the
			perpetrators of these atrocitires/war crimes and check which people genuinely
			had an actual choice. People who are not competent at checking things genuinely
			and actually and who engage in that behaviour are commiting war criems themselves
			that could make it even harder to clean up other war crimes. People who engage
			in that behavour need to be held accountable for the war crimes they have 
			commited. Those who join in with stalling any attempt to educate people and
			have people held accountable for these problems are basically also putting
			themselves out as targets to be cleared. People who think that's a bit harsh
			really don't have any damn clue about what sexual abuse is like for the
			actual victims, or what it's like for the people who are gaslighted about
			people being sexually abused while other people are actually being sexually
			abused or abused in other unacceptable ways. 
		
			It's not fun having to teach the girls that if someone rapes a kid in to them
			the whole community is going to let their rapist keep them. Even then very few
			of the pathetic males who claim to care about those girls/women will actually
			make the right commitments about not abusing/raping, helping prevent abuse from
			occuring in the first place and rescuing people from it if it does happen (without
			expecting to be able to own/rape people, or be able to force people to go on dates
			with them and 'give them a chance').
		
			People who are making decisions that affect other people's lives need to know
			enough so that the decisions they make do not make the lives of the actual 
			victims actually worse off, and the people who try to manipulate society so
			that the previous sentence works as a 'better life' when the victims are with
			their rapists need to be rounded up. People who refuse to discuss these topics
			properly are usually either held hostage/prisoner or involved with causing
			these sorts of problems, or other problems that need to be identified and
			put to an end, with any victims/hostages/prisoners being rescued. 
		
			It is completely unacceptable for people who are engaging in behaviour that's
			holding someone prisoner in misery to be involved with gaslighting the victim(s),
			if someone's relationship match is just sleeping around behind their back it is
			pretty fucked up for the community to also lie and force the victims held prisoner
			in misery to call the rapists or people causing even more damage to the community
			friends, family, school mates, teammates, and force them to interact with those
			people. That kind of behaviour is a war crime in and of itself, and people need
			to be held accountable for these war crimes. We need to clean up the past, present
			and future! 
		
			People who rape people then lie to the people who actually care about the victims
			should be locked up and kept away from their victims for life. People who sleep with 
			other people's actual relationship matches should be treated similary, rape or
			no rape. Especially those who hold people prisoner in misery and wont let them 
			actually do anything that's actually fun for them. 
		
			People who claim they will help look after victims only to further their suffering
			are commiting war crimes. Especially if that involves forcing people to let them
			look after people, making threats to ruing people's lives and turn people against 
			each other, lying to people, rushing people, misleading, forcing, tormenting,
			gaslighting, etc. etc.. People who say they know what they are doing on these topics
			without letting people check and without properly checking themselves are war crimes. 
			Where are the armies that will help round up people guilty of that kind of behaviour?
		
			If people are making accusations about another person, they should be allowed
			to explain themselves, and to people who aren't going to lie about what they
			have said, aren't going to lie to the other victims just to help have the 
			victims handed back to the abusers. If people do not do that properly when 
			they claim to be competent on these topics then they need to be locked up.
			People's lives are destroyed from that kind of behaviour and it's time the
			world stops treating that like some funny joke. 
		
			We really do not care about friendships and 'hanging out', we like people who
			work hard and actually help figure out what's going on when there's a problem,
			help fix hostage situations properly, don't just gaslight the victims so that
			the abusers can keep their victims. People who verbally/emotionally/psychologically
			abuse people without defending themselves need to be called out for what they 
			are doing and have done. Sometimes they are seeking a retaliation so that they
			can paint the victims out as the perpetrators, other times the victims are made
			to turn against each other under threats of violence from the rapists and abusers
			to each of them and/or other people. The world needs to wake up to what has
			happened there and start cleaning up the hostage situation. 
		
			The courts need to be run properly, so do the academic institutions and the
			education systems. For too long people have completely ignored incomptence
			while refusing to discuss things properly with the people who are capable
			of doing so and have made the right commitments about intentions so on
			and so forth. People who have joined in with the rapists keeping their
			victims for so long really need to be cleared. 
		
			People who voluntarily join in with turning the victims against each other,
			making people do things under bad enough threats that cause problems to the
			rest of the community need to be locked up. Those who voluntarily join in 
			with behaviour that ruins communities need to be locked up or held
			accountable for their actions properly. How is the world not fighting
			these sorts of problems? 
		
			It is worse for people to help someone resist being held accountable for war
			crimes than it is to resist being arrested by the police. People who think
			the police are able to fight sex abuse and hold the right people back from
			training up cause too many problems on this planet (people need to commit
			to not sexually abusing people, or doing anything including asking other
			people to ruin other people's lives and turning victims against each other
			just so the rapists can get their victims, committing for 'about a week' is
			an insult to all abuse victims). 
		
			We want an end to forced relationships, prostitution (both legally and
			illegally), involuntary porn, child porn, involuntary cam modelling, forced 
			adoptions, forced friendships, stolen experiences, society just handing
			victims to abusers, bullying, people being held back when they have the right
			intentions. We want society to have the strength to let people who aren't
			going to do the wrong thing to live their lives reasonably freely without
			just having to live their lives as slaves and/or worse to the abusers. 
		
			Those who don't want these sorts of problems, especially those who are 
			victim to them are going to remain victim to them until the world works
			towards putting an end to all of these problems and having the strength,
			intellect etc. to combat these problems rather than just handing the
			victims back to the rapists. 
		
			People should not be putting themselves above others just using strength,
			intellect or otherwise alone. People need to have the right intentions,
			though that is not always enough as well. People need to be willing and 
			able to discuss these topics properly without being rushed and without
			threats of violence or otherwise which basically dictate the victim's or
			victims' lives with what's 'a better life' or 'safer' etc.. That is not
			a peaceful society/world, we need to earn peace not declare it, it's a
			good way of looking stupid in the meantime though. 
		
			The threateners are the ones guilty of abuse and turning victims against
			each other, not the threatenees/victims.
		
			Peace is earnt by winning the wars from the past, present and future
			and turning things around for good, or putting an end to things for good.
			We cannot leave war crimes from the past unpunished, resisting being
			held accountable for a war crime, or helping someone avoid being held
			accountable for a war crime is far worse than something like a petty
			theif resisting arrest.
		
			People who destroy the lives of people helping fight these problems just
			so they can abuse victims themselves need to be locked up. If they have 
			refused to get educated on the topics and discuss them properly that is
			not a get out of jail free card. Society needs to wake up there.
		
			A lot of people set up kids being sexually abused or being in 'child porn'
			so that a lot of other people in society let those people rape basically
			whoever they want for the rest of their lives. It is not okay for people
			who have been abused to use that as a reason to abuse other people. The
			disgusting abusers will do everything they can to turn that around so that
			it looks like the actual victims are the perpetrators so society lets the
			actual perpetrators do whatever they want to their victims. Educate people
			who claim to actually want to fight abuse and test them on their
			understanding. 
		
			A lot of different people in society are abusers, a lot of jocks, soldiers,
			athletes, doctors, lawyers, academics, etc. are not happy with the people
			who are interested in them (even if they are very interesting and appealing)
			so still do all sorts of horrible things to set up being able to abuse the
			people who don't want to be interacting with them, sexually or otherwise.
			Then let all sorts of other abuse and problems occur to help cover up what
			they are doing to their victims. We need people to combat these problems 
			globally in all areas. 
		
			Many abuse victims have no choice but to believe whatever their abusers say,
			to do everything they can to convince the rest of society those are the
			people they want to be interacting with and be horrible to the people they
			actually care about. Please help put an end to that kind of nightmare 
			globally.
		
			People should not be allowed anywhere near people that might be made to come
			on to or be friends with them, have their experiences stolen from them etc. 
			until they are capable of understanding that that does not make it okay. 
			Watch out for people who get their victims to say it's fine when they are
			not able to say so genuinely. People who help steal other people's
			experiences away from them need to be held accountable for their actions,
			society needs to start preventing these things from happening. 
		
			People who think it's okay for them to sexually abuse people just for helping
			rescue them or other people need to be locked up. People who help make society
			a nightmare for people who interact with the people they actually want to 
			interact with if people aren't just causing them problems need to be locked
			up. If the cops, courts, etc. aren't on board with that then publicise that
			to the rest of the world. Places like that need to be taken over, though bear
			in mind they usually have victims held hostage in such places. 
		
			We want people to be able to make their own informed choices in life, have
			opportunities for them at their competence levels, but not also hold people
			back from progressing for the wrong reasons (like what abusers do so that
			the rest of society will let them keep their victims and have the abusers
			treated like victims while the victims are treated like abusers). We do
			still want people to work hard so that we can actually fix these sorts of 
			problems society wide, and want people to be able to do so without fear of 
			their work being stolen, or being allowed to be used for all sorts of bad
			things including but not limited to sexual abuse.
		
			If people aren't strong enough to prevent people from putting them in a
			position where they get abused it does not mean they deserve it. Adults
			being abused by kids (even if they're made to be the ones to contribute
			to it) does not mean the adults are the perpetrators, including all forms
			of sexual abuse. 
		
			It is not okay to say that the victims should do more to get themselves
			rescued or make it clear to other people that they are hostages, the world
			needs to do more to become educated on these topics and help rescue people
			from these situations worldwide. We do not care what gender, race,
			nationality, sexuality, etc. people are, though we do care whether they 
			are rapists and if people are going to get offended about that kind of thing
			when there are people stuck in abusive situations worldwide that is a
			problem! 
		
			Other things to watch out for and help fight are people being held back under
			threats, not being allowed to be themselves under threats and people lying
			about why that is. People having their identities/work/achievements/results/
			research/personality/jokes/etc. stolen and used by people for all sorts
			of horrible things. We need to get to the point as a society that we can
			do something about these problems when they happen rather than having to
			let the abusers get away with all sorts of things so that it is a 
			'better life' for the victims.
		
			People who think it's okay to just grant custody or otherwise of people
			need to be kept away from the victims in society and not be allowed to make
			decisions like that which affect other people's lives, especially if they
			do not know the actual truth. If people are unwilling to learn the actual 
			truth on topics then people should be very weary about any opinions they
			have on any topics relevant to that, and should not be allowed to be involved
			with making decisions that affect the lives of victims of those topics. 
		
			The actual truth on some topics is too unbearable for some victims, that
			does not make it okay for the rest of society to leave victims in abusive
			situations. People who think if someone is sexually abused enough times they
			should belong to their abuser(s) need to be locked up. The more instances and
			degree of sexual abuse makes the crimes worse not 'better', people should not 
			be allowed to keep their victims if there is a child as a result of sexual
			abuse, and the victims should not be forced to interact with the abusers or
			the children if they aren't able to establish that they actually do not pose
			a danger to other people. Sexual abuse is worse when a child results from 
			the behaviour. The world needs to wake up to that.
		
			People who say 'it's already happened', or 'there's children involved' 
			without giving a shit whether sexual abuse is involved need to be locked
			up. 
		
			A lot of people throughout society are somehow successful at having the
			victims labelled as the perpetrators. We need people to wake up to these 
			problems, get educated on the topics and help turn around these problems
			worldwide. 
		
			Some people join in with causing problems whenever people are getting work
			done, then join in with not causing problems when people are exhausted and
			need to recover. People who engage in that behaviour just to help the abusers
			get their victims need to be locked up. 
		
			DO NOT educate people on these topics unless they are actually willing to
			discuss their understanding of what they have learnt, what their actual
			opinions are and make actual lifelong commitments about whether they 
			are on board with fighting all of these problems society wide, including
			a lot of other abuse problems that are too dangerous to discuss without
			a lot of actual lifelong commitments. 
		
			People who can't speak genuinely and don't know how people can and cannot lie
			using the word actually should not be involved with making decisons that 
			affect how other people must live their lives. That doesn't mean people who
			can speak genuinely and understand how people can and cannot lie using the
			word actually have the right intentions and will help prevent rather than 
			cause abuse throughout society.
		
			There are more ways than strength to help combat abuse. Learning to discuss
			topics properly and educating other people about how to discuss topics
			properly can be helpful, working really hard and making sure other people
			are safe from abuse in lots of different ways can also be very helpful.
		
			Help educate people across society on these topics and test their
			understanding of various topics. We need the courts, psychs, cops, (extreme)
			sports, education system, (game) developers, academia, corporations, 
			financial institutions, credit card companies, miners, airlines, armies,
			intelligence services, military, religions, engineers, manufacturers, hackers,
			mensa, tool makers (eg. openGL devs), etc. to all get on board with fighting
			these sorts of problems rather than helping cause them!
		
			Competitions should be fun, not ruin/destroy people's lives. As should all
			hobbies, schools, sports, workplaces, bars, etc., though people's safety
			is also important! Anyone who voluntarily has anything to do with people's
			safety being bet on any kind of competition needs to be identified and locked
			up.
		
			Help put an end to friendships, relationships and families that are forced,
			involving all sorts of awful tricks leading to a horrible world for the
			victims. Make sure victims are safe from their perpetrators for good. 
		
			We do not care if people are taking drugs as part of a hostage situation, 
			whether it be for one or many reasons, though do care if people are using
			not being sobre as an excuse for causing abuse of the wrong kind. While
			legalisation of drugs would likely not be good for society, the lives of
			some people, including some forms of chronic pain and abuse victims can be
			much better with some drugs. Society needs to stop treating these people 
			like the monsters in society rather than the actual abusers/perpetrators.
			The abusers often give some of the victims a 'better life' when some of the
			other victims engage in drug use or do other things to ruin their reputation
			and lives. The world needs to start fighting these problems rather than just
			joining in with causing them. 
		
			We do care if people use alcohol or drugs as a way to sexually abuse people, 
			or force people to even have casual sex when they don't want to be. People 
			who engage in that behaviour need to be kept away from people they pose a
			danger to. 
		
			Be very careful of people who use other people's identities, achievements, 
			etc. etc., society needs to get to a point where people like that can be
			locked up. 
		
			Become experts on things like drugs, alcohol, duress, rape, abuse,
			relationships, religions, forced relationships/friendships/marriages/breakups,
			kidnapping, human trafficking, threats, hostage situations, witnessing, 
			evidence, computers, mathematics, logic, English, court systems, prison
			systems, intelligence, financial systems/institutions, economics, programming
			web development, using things properly, forums, moderation, administrating, 
			managing, sponsorship (often rife with abuse for some people), sports clubs, 
			extreme sports, education systems, academia, research, science, medicine 
			(not just what's done in thehospitals), ethics, morals, plagirism, cheating
			fraud, identity theft, impersonation, persecution, political systems, economic
			systems etc. etc..
		
			We do need some people on the internet unfiltered, we need people becoming 
			educated on how bad things are both on and off the internet. We need people
			witnessing, collecting evidence (if they have the strength to keep it safe).
			Passing evidence and information along to the authorities when the
			authorities have no choice but to give the victims back to the abusers more 
			often than not just makes the lives of the victims given to the abusers even
			worse. When a community reaches that point and they do not have the strength
			to do anything about it we need ways for people to get outside help. 
			Unfortunately a lot of the ways there currently, like sports, authorities,
			militaries etc. are not doing their jobs properly, they are overrun by people
			who just join in with turning the victims against each other. 
		
			People who join the army/military without the right intentions, who will
			sexually abuse people, force people in to situations they don't want to be
			in etc. are scum!
		
			In the past people from wr3ckreational have been made to put child porn on the
			internet and leave it there under threat of violence. People need to wake up
			to these sorts of things happening and help identify the real perpetrators in
			society so they can be kept away from their victims for good. People make 
			threats to turn the victims against each other, like to abuse animals (the actual
			abusers get so violent when society checks about threats) or make victims live 
			their lives like losers (also making it easier for the rapists to lie about there
			being threats and where they're coming from), to gain weight etc. etc.. which also
			helps the actual victims/perpetrators be treated like the perpetrators/victims 
			by society and helps the perpetrators have their victims handed to them by 
			society. Please help fight these problems. 
		
			Lots of people have claimed to be part of wr3ckreational only to join in with
			forcing people to play along for them, making them join a 'better life', engaging
			in behaviour that tears entire communities apart and causes problems for the
			rest of the planet. People who voluntarily engage in that behaviour are holding
			the rest of the world hostage, we need to take back over from them.
