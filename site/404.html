			================================================================
		
			wr3ckreational started as a play on words combining wreck and
			recreational to recognise what various things go through so that
			we can train up to fight abuse, in particular the global war to
			end sexual abuse on planet earth, ie. for sexual abuse to never
			happen again on planet earth. 
		
			Do not trust people who claim to be onside with these wars
			and/or onside with wr3ckreational without thoroughly questioning
			people when they are actually speaking genuinely. 
		
			"Should we trust?" "fuck no!"
		
			We encourage people to get educated on how much of an actual
			problem human trafficking, sexual abuse, forced relationships,
			promises, dibbsing, people whose idea of stealing is kidnap and
			rape etc. are on planet earth and get onside with the war to 
			make sure sexual abuse never happens again on planet earth. If 
			a kid sexually abuses an adult, the kid is the sexual abuser. 
		
			It is not okay to tell people who to fall for, even if there's 
			enough heinous people on the planet to claim any kind of 
			democratic bullshit on that topic. Raping kids in to people
			is far worse, any attempt to prolong the suffering of people
			who are targets to rapists is considered sabotage in the war
			efforts to end sexual abuse, including making them play along
			for their rapist's rape family/families. People who refuse to
			get educated on these topics and refuse to learn what they are
			and are not competent at and stick to the things they are
			competent at etc. are considered part the enemy in these wars.
			Especially if they still give opinions on these topics front of
			house or behind the scenes.
		
			These problems are to be cleaned up from the past, present and
			future. Anyone who thinks the present and future can be cleaned
			up without cleaning up the past should be given a very quick 
			chance to wake the fuck up and be educated, otherwise treat them
			as complicit to the suffering that has happened on planet earth
			without justice being served. 
		
			We want people to figure out what they are and are not good at
			and hone those skills to be used as weapons against sexual abuse
			on planet earth. Everything is a weapon, it depends what it is
			used for, is it a danger to the rapist society or contributing
			to prolonging the suffering of who and what the rapists on this
			planet target? A lot of the other heinous problems on this
			planet are often caused to cover up the heinous problems with
			sexual abuse or any attempts to fight the other heinous problems
			are sabotaged in all sorts of ways that further ruins the lives
			of innocent people and prolongs the suffering of who the rapists
			target on planet earth. 
		
			Slaughter everyone complicit to the prolonged suffering of the 
			people targeted most by rapists on this planet.
