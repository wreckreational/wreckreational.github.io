			WR3CKREATIONAL is for ending the wrong kinds of abuse, anyone who's 
			eligible may consider themselves a member, though you will find it 
			is far from safe to reveal your membership, especially while the
			world is run by rapists and there are hostage situations ongoing globally.
			Membership is entirely voluntary.
		
			It doesn't matter how old you are, if you aren't helping people have an
			actual choice in life then you are part of the problems of the world, 
			that does not include the people who help set up people having a
			'better life' with the abusers/rapists.
		
			Competitions should be fun, not ruin/destroy people's lives. As should all
			hobbies, schools, sports, workplaces, bars, etc., though people's safety
			is also important!
		
			Help put an end to friendships, relationships and families that are forced,
			involving all sorts of awful tricks leading to a horrible world for the
			victims. Make sure victims are safe from their perpetrators for good. 
		
			You are not eligible if you have voluntarily contributed to putting anyone
			in any of the situations that we are trying to put an end to. And should make
			it clear to anyone who knows about WR3CKREATIONAL that we are not interested
			in people making situations like that happen with them claiming they are 
			trying to 'reward people' or some other kind of fucked up excuse to cause
			further harm to the world and everything on it. 
		
			DO NOT publicise WR3CKREATIONAL to people who are not going to be able to 
			understand the implications of all the rules, including extrapolating what
			is and is not acceptable behaviour, which cannot be explained to people
			easily as people turn around and say that's what gave them the idea to engage
			in such behaviour in the first place.
